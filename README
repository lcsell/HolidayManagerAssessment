Summary
=======

This learning project (housed chiefly in main.py) tracks holidays for the years of 2020 to 2024.

These holidays were scraped from a website to serve as the content of the tracker, plus a few that were pre-provided.

Some weather information was gathered from an API as well


Use
====
You can use this holiday tracker to add or delete holidays of your choosing.

You may view sub lists of holidays by week

If you choose the current week of the current year, you may view weekly weather data.

Finally, you may save the list of holidays to a JSON file.

Config
=====
main.py relies on config.py, which I have excluded per my instructions.


Growth Goals
==========
1. I want to learn to use the lambda function I commented out at line 172 properly.

2. I want to find a more elegant way of integrating the weather data with the current week's holidays.


Thank you for reading.
